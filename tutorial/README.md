Slash shot is the wavedash of gunz
Half step is the dash dance
And reload shot is the L cancel


If you like Melee, and you like shooters, you will probably like Gunz. 

This video and its description contains all the information a Melee player should need to learn Gunz the duel. 

Basic first person shooter principles apply.

Freestyle gunz is where the Melee community is playing right now. iBDW, S2J, myself, and many others smash players are playing. 

If you haven’t played Gunz in a long time, leading is gone. Aim straight at your opponent, as you do in all modern shooters.

I’m going to assume that you’re experienced learning techskill, so I am not going to spend a long time on each move. If you need more info on a move, check the description.

Default controls are not perfect in this game. For the basics, simply re-bind block to right click, and alt fire to shift. Besides that, I will use default controls to demonstrate moves.


These moves are listed in approximately the order I’d recommend learning them in.


-----------------------------------------------BEGINNER-------------------------------------------------
Timed dashes
Dash > dash
This moves you quickly and keeps you airborne longer when timed perfectly

Buffered bunny hop
Jump > jump (buffered)
Just press space before landing to maintain momentum

Double dash flash step / shotless half step

Silent double flash step

An advanced movement technique for rollouts from spawn

Late dash
Shoot > reload > switch to sword > dash
This is only possible if your key bindings allow you to press W/A/S/D, reload, and sword at the exact same time. You will at the very least need to bind sword to something other than 1. Many people bind sword and reload to any one of mouse 3, scroll up, scroll down, mouse 4, mouse 5, or any other buttons they have have on their mouse. This distributes the load of inputs between both your hands keeping your left hand free for good movement.

Late dash half step

Magic switch
Ghost evade > Switch to gun

These techniques are becoming way too advanced.... are you really going to learn this?

GDHS
??? > ???
There are several more gunz techniques that I can not do and I do not know enough about to explain. Links for info on some of them are in the description.

There are many more techniques in the game, but most of them are significantly less important than the ones in this video. Learning even a small fraction of the techniques in this video will get you well on your way to becoming a K-style pro. I hope you enjoy playing my favorite shooter.

If you need help with anything in GunZ, feel free to ask! I and many others are willing to help all new players to the game.

Please try Gunz it’s amazing

It’s my favorite game… And I’m not the only one:
https://clips.twitch.tv/RelatedVenomousLocustSSSsss-9sqmE0u1nNgbDT4L
IBDW, S2J, TheRealThing, TSM_Daequan, TSM Dyrus, myself, and many more people play GunZ. I saw Bab Activated log on, and I heard Mang0 thinks GunZ is cool. We have a clan called SSBM (ran by iBDW). The game is free, come play with the boys :)

Some pointers on common problems you may be having:

Any move: I can’t switch my weapons fast enough
DONT USE Q/E. Ok well you can, but just know that they have a long cooldown… something like 800ms, so you can only use them every now and then.

Butterfly / slash shot: block / gun isn’t coming out
You may be slashing before the dash instead of after. If the dash is silent, then that is the issue.

Wall climb: my character is flipping
All you have to do to stop the flip is slash. If you’re doing the move right though, you’ll never see the flip. Don’t mash these inputs, get yourself airborne by jumping, then do the inputs quickly: dash slash jump… wait… dash slash jump… wait… etc

Gear tap: my character is rolling
You either didn’t slash on the way up, or you’re inputting the dash too late.

Reload shot: my shots are slower
You’re either not getting the reload cancel correct, or you’re just not doing the inputs fast enough. Try just shoot > sword. Then, try shoot > reload > sword. The second one should be faster as there’s no delay switching to your sword. When doing reload shot, shoot+reload+switch are pressed nearly at the same time, 1 frame apart

Static double butterfly: slash not coming out
You are either mashing the inputs, or you are pressing block before slash. There’s a lot of leniency on the timing for DBF, so take it slow and add some more gaps between the moves. DBF does not need to be anywhere near frame perfect.

Reload half step: I can’t do it or I can only do it in certain directions
Are you on default controls? I demonstrate this with default controls because that’s how I learned it, but it’s significantly harder on default controls than if you bind things to your mouse. Many people put reload, sword, and even guns on their mouse so that their left hand isn’t so overworked. I would recommend rebinding controls to make this easier, especially given you’ll have to eventually anyways to learn late dash.

Forbidden step: I can’t get the slash after the dash
You’re doing everything too slow. There can be a few different causes of this, such as missing the reload cancel, but take a look at the above comment on RHS, because maybe it’s your controls that are holding you back.

Hands: they hurt
The game is very intense and requires you to use muscles that may not be very developed in your arm. As long as your hand/arm aren’t hurting too bad, you’ll probably be fine. The more you play, the more strength and stamina you’ll build, making everything less tiring / painful.

Instafall: It’s not working for some reason
The only thing that determines if it works is the amount of time between the flip and the slash. You can decrease this time by timing your block better, jumping at the exact same time as you block, blocking for a shorter amount of time, and/or slashing sooner.

TBF: I just can’t
Do you still have block on shift by chance? Or is your framerate capped to something that’s not 250? It could be one of those issues. If it’s not, then you probably just need more practice pressing slash and block as close together, and pressing block for as little time as possible. I take my fingers quite far off my mouse when I do TBF so that I can aggressively tap and release block very quickly.

Late dash: Why are you pressing shift in the video
Shift is my sword key. I’m a boomer in this game and can never give up my glorious keyboard spam. I think it’s optimal to use your mouse, but I’m going to try to learn late dash using keyboard only, by binding sword to 1/shift, and reload to Q/R.

Ghost evade: It’s not working
There may be specific angles or timings that it works at. There may also be counters to this (that aren’t just shooting ofc). I don’t know very much about this move, and I suck at it, so ask someone else.

Aim: I suck at aiming
No you don’t. Do you own a 200$+ gaming monitor, a 60$+ mouse, and a large mousepad? Even if you do, it’s possible you have certain settings wrong either on your computer or in game that is holding you back. Double check that enhance pointer precision is disabled within windows. Aiming is a complicated subject, but nobody can aim well if their setup is bad. Make sure your setup isn’t bad via ensuring you have good hardware and correct in game settings.
