Yet another MySQL database only due to the fact people keep PMing me for the last one I released ages a go. <br>

Based on Jurien's 1.5 repack database and originally done for another server that actually converted their server and client to MySQL. Some tables will generate errors for some reason which the server owner fixed and refuses to tell me how he did it. So good luck on that I guess?<br>

Kept it clean as possible if there are those who want to look at it.<br>

Remember to use MySQL's ODBC connector.<br>
