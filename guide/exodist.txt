CHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTION

************************

Gunz is an online, third person shooter with some RPG elements hacked on, which
actually work pretty well. So sooner or later, there had to be a quest mode.
Promised for International Gunz, appearing in North American Gunz, quest mode
can be a blast. Although its not a good source of training at all, its still
pretty fun to play. I am no master at Quest mode, if there isn't anything in my
guide which is in the game, then sorry, I didn't know about it. Currently, there
is only one quest level, but more quests and such are soon to come, so whenever
Gunz quest mode gets updated, hopefully, this guide will be too. Good luck with
quest mode, and enjoy the game!

OK, you can check the END OF DOCUMENT chapter (6) to find all of this guides
update information.

I will write a little here though. Basically, I stopped playing Gunz for a long
time, at the measly level of 23. Well, my friend started playing, and so I did,
and now many of my other friends all play (we have our own clan too). Now, im
level 24 at time of writing, half way to 25, and I plan to continue this guide.
This is just a quick update, considering this is 20KB and on gamefaqs its only
13. Either way, I hope to improve the guide massively, so good luck to me.

*****************************

CHAPTER 2 - BASIC INFORMATION

*****************************

STARTING OUT:

First off, you will want to be a decent level, or just be extremely skilled at
Gunz before attempting a quest. Then, make sure you connect to either Quest West
or Quest East servers, you cannot do quests on any other server. Now, go to
whatever channel you want, and create/join a game. First you might want to
create your own with a password to get used to it, but I don't recommend it. OK,
select QUEST from the game type selection, the other options you cannot change.
The level HAS to be Mansion, the max players are 4, and you can't have a time
limit. Now, to the left, you can see slots for items. If you use a page, which
you can buy from the shop (only on a quest server) you can get to different
quest levels. Thus far I have only played on Quest Levels 1 and 2, and am not
certain if there are currently more. You can use items gained in the actual
quest too, but these don't seem to be useful at the current time. Once every
one is ready, its time to start.

PLAYING QUEST MODE:

Once the game starts, it will place you into a random room, based on the current
level (which would be Mansion). All of the players will start at the same place,
and are given a couple of seconds to get ready. Soon, the monsters will start
to spawn all over the level. Now, you must try to kill them obviously. Once all
of the NPCs have been defeated, a portal will open up, giving all of the players
around 30 or so seconds to get there. The portal will take the players to the
next stage, where it repeats itself, but of course, at a different location. You
may fight in the same locations again, and the stages can vary from 6-8 (at
least, thats how many I have seen). If a player dies, they cannot respawn until
the next round, if all players die, the quest is over.

QUEST MODE - MORE DETAIL:

OK, so what else is there in quest? Well, you may expect to run out of ammo
quickly, which in most cases, you do. Around the levels, health restorers, AP
restorers, and also Ammo will respawn randomly, in different places. The harder
the quest level, and higher stage level your on, the less they restore, mainly
the health though, which can restore very little at times. Also, you may notice
chests randomly spawn, although these are a lot rarer then the HP, AP and Ammo
upgrades. These contain quest items, at the moment, your just best off selling
them, check the items chapter for more detail in them. Also, in the future,
you will be able to fight special bosses, you may be able to fight one now, but
if so, I haven't. Watching the Gunz trailer, toward the end, you will see some
people fighting a giant goblin with a massive hammer inside the library part of
the Mansion level. Maybe this is in the current version, although I do not know.
Also, when the players get to the next stage, all of their HP, AP and ammo is
fully restored.

***********************

CHAPTER 3 - QUEST GUIDE

***********************

*******
MANSION
*******

Currently, there is only the mansion level playable. Once into the mansion level
you will go through 6-8 or so stages, fighting goblin after goblin after goblin.
When playing, the game will put you onto a random location, which is similar to
the mansion, to fight in. Currently, I have seen these rooms.

Garden Hallway:
 _      _     _
| |____| |___| |
|              |
|  __________  |
|_|          |_|

This is a hallway, similar to the hallways found in the Garden level. Above is
some dodgey ASCII map thing, its meant to be the stage. Thats about all I can
remember of it though, so if its not completely accurate, don't blame me. The
players will spawn at the bottom right location, and the portal, usually just
across from there, although I think it may just be random. This stage is usually
an early one, and never really causes much trouble, even when the harder enemies
run loose on it.

Garden Hallway 2:
 ________________
|  ____________  |
| |            | |
| |            | |
| |            | |
|_|            |_|

This is another hallway level, similar to the Garden level hallways. Above is
another dodgey ASCII map thing, which may not be very accurate, but again, its
a rough drawing of the stage. This stage usually appears (for me at least) very
early on, and is fairly easy. The players will start to the bottom left part of
the map, and the portal usually appears either side.

Garden:
         _
   _____| |_____
 _|             |_
|_               _|
  | ____   ____ |
  |  ___   ___  |
  | |         | |
  | |         | |
  | |         | |
  |_____________|

Yes, its a VERY poor drawing, but I can explain. This stage is pretty much the
garden part of, guess what, the garden level! Of course, all exits are blocked,
the players start at the bottom middle part of the level, where the fountain
usually is. The hedges are still there, and then there are steps leading up to
the main part, where all the action takes place. This level usually appears mid
quest for me, its not too hard, but it can get chaotic up top.

Mansion Stairs:
 ____________
|            |
|            |
|            |
|            |
|            |
|            |
|            |
|____________|

Well, er, thats pretty much it. Except there are pillars all along it, but its
more or less the main Mansion room, minus the stairs, minus any exits, the
colour is a lot more red, and there is a big door on a wall. Wow. You start at
either end, I can't remember which. This stage is usually pretty late, and has
a lot of the armoured Goblins. Its not too difficult, if your low, you can just
dash around the edge until power ups appear. Simple really.

Mansion Cellar:

OK, I don't have a map, I can't exactly remember the whole of it. But, its
basically, the cellar with a lot of stairs, leading to a giant grey/black wall.
You should know what I mean, this is a pretty early stage, usually when those
Goblin Gunners start appearing.

Mansion Cellar 2:

 ____________
|            |
|            |
|            |
|            |
|            |
|            |
|            |
|____________|

Again, this is just like the Mansion Stairs, its a big room, with pillars, but
has more of a cellar feel to it. Oh, and fire torches all around the room. So
yeah, same rules apply really.

Mansion Library:

 ____________
|  ___  ___  |
| |        | |
| |        | |
|            |
|            |
| |        | |
| |___  ___| |
|____________|

This is an annoying level. It seems really hard, especially if your trying to
solo quest mode. Basically, its a the library from mansion. The lines in the
middle of the room are bookcases. If your out of ammo, try to stay around the
edges, dashing, and be ready to collect pick ups! In the middle is where all
the action goes on, unless your good, stay away!

Mansion Place:

 ____________
| _________  |
|            |
| |        | |
| |        | |
| |        | |
| |        | |
| _________  |
|____________|

Mansion place hey? I don't know what it is, its just this random room I guess.
This is usually last, or very close to being last. Basically, the middle, is a
pit, but not really much of a pit. The gaps in the outline are stairs, the
players start in the middle. This is kinda hard, but not that hard. The stage
is pretty much the library, but seems to be much easier to me.

Mansion Dining Room:

 ______
|      |
|      |
|      |
|      |
|      |
|      |
|______|

This is a kinda annoying stage. Basically, its the dining room, complete with
the table straight down the middle. Usually, its pretty easy to complete, be
careful, it seems that many gunners are placed onto the table. Apart from that
it shouldn't be too much of a problem.

Below, are the monsters seen in the Mansion quest level. They're all Goblins,
and there are around five different types. Read on for more information!

GOBLIN:

Just a normal goblin, carries a small knife, or maybe a short sword. Easiest to
kill, and the most common enemy too. These are seen on the Mansion level.

GOBLIN GUNNER:

These have rifle guns, which fire small bombs, the distance isn't that great,
but when the explode, the radius is big. These usually stay out of the battle to
try and snipe, if you can, kill them with a melee weapon. These are seen on the
Mansion level.

GOBLIN ARMOUR:

These are bigger goblins. They have big clubs, and are heavily armoured. These
can do more damage then the rest, and take more hits to kill. Don't worry, you
can shoot them any where, just shoot! They appear often, mainly toward the end
of the quest. These are seen on the Mansion level.

GOBLIN MAGE:

Goblin Mages are small goblins in the brown cloaks. They heal themselves and
other goblin's which are usually in large groups. These are seen on the Mansion
level.

GOBLIN SHAMAN:

Part Goblin part voodoo ritualist, these guys are big and tough. They can take
up to three rounds of ammunition without dying. They can hit you ranged and in
melee, and can cast a spell to make you move slower, if this happens, ALWAYS
move! Recommended to take these guys down first. These are seen on the Mansion
level.

*******
DUNGEON
*******

The brand new level, as of the 14th Feb update of Ijji Gunz. OK, so I just
played it at Quest level 1, pretty easy (level 21 character), no deaths, and
just complete general ownage. That was my first play, and we had around four
rounds. OK, the levels seem to be based on parts, or sections, of the Dungeon
level, where as the Mansion level has some new rooms. Obviously on my initial
Dungeon play through, I didn't see all the rooms, and I have more Quest levels
to play through. Noticed the new enemies too, they're all skeletons. I only saw
three different types, the first two were pretty easy, but the last third type
was kinda kick-ass. Below are the rooms I have seen and can remember properly.

STAIR WAY:

This level will be instantly recognisable to any one who has played Dungeon.
Remember the really small stairways where right clicking with a sword equipped
can bag easy kills? Well, this is part of the Dungeon level. It's just the stair
way room though, every one starts at the bottom, so you have some stairs to
climb up before you can get to the top. The enemies spawn on the steps, right
in the middle, so you have to be careful. Also, if any of the Skeleton Armours
spawn, be careful, these can be tough to defeat on the stair way.

SMALL ROOM:

I don't really have a name for this room. It's a small square room, I can't
remember which, but it's the starting room for one of the teams for Team
Deathmatch on Dungeon. It has like, a VERY small well in it too. This level is
small, but pretty easy, just fire away in this cramped space.

The Dungeon introduces a new type of enemy, the Skeleton. Loosely based on the
Goblins (in terms of enemy types) I have seen three Skeleton types thus far.
Unfortunately, they were all easy to beat as such, but either way, they're all
below.

SKELETON WARRIOR:

The basic skeleton enemy, these are just skeletons in brown coloured armour,
with swords and shields. At level 21, these went down easy, they died in just
a couple of shots from x2 SMG, much more faster than the Goblins. Also, they
walk and are pretty slow. They respawn at high rate, but they don't seem to pose
much of a threat. These are seen on the Dungeon level.

SKELETON MAGE:

These are normal skeletons, but in a big brown cloak. These are incredibly weak,
but they can cast damaging magic at a range. You should take them out with a
sword, as that will kill them quick, you shouldn't waste your ammo as such on
these. Their attacks are pretty weak too. These are seen on the Dungeon level.

SKELETON ARMOUR:

These are bigger skeletons, in red (or something) armour, wielding giant swords.
Once you get in a certain distance with in them, they charge at you, much more
quicker then the other Skeletons, ready to attack you. These take more shots
than the Warriors, but aren't too tough. Be warned though, these can be an
absolute pain on the Stair Way room on Dungeon. Again, these are seen on the
Dungeon level.

CHAPTER 5 - QUEST ENEMIES

*************************

Currently, there are only goblins, 4 types if I am correct (at least, thats all
I have seen). They are listed below.

GOBLIN:

Just a normal goblin, carries a small knife, or maybe a short sword. Easiest to
kill, and the most common enemy too. These are seen on the Mansion level.

CHAPTER 6 - END OF DOCUMENT

***************************

Well, I got an email the other day, telling me that the sender can help
contribute toward my guide. Well, that person did, so a BIG THANKS to Rack, who
contributed the following: Info on Goblin Shaman, info on Future Quest items,
and info on future quest enemies.

OK, on the 14th of February 2007, the quest mode of North American (Ijji) Gunz
was updated. Now, recently I have been playing some World of Warcraft, and some
of my 360 games, so I haven't had much to play Gunz. But, when im bored of
playing these (I just get moments I just can't be bothered), then Gunz is a
possible resort. Now, there are only three major update catagories, but there
are more updates with in these. First off, we have, a brand new, never before
seen quest boss for Mansion. Also, there is a brand new map, the Dungeon, and
there are also new enemy types to be introduced.
