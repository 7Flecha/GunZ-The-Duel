  Introduction                                     I0
=====================================================

  GunZ: the Duel (henceforth simply GunZ) is an online third person shooter
  game with a few exceptional features (some glitches) that set it apart
  in the genre.  On the surface it appears to be the standard dodge, aim,
  and shoot at people TPS, and essentially that appearance is correct.
  However, the depth (read: real value) of this game comes in the form of move
  combos and technique cancels that would not be out of place in a 2D fighter.

  An actual game story exists outside the game with in-game references to
  that story (starting classes, item descriptions, etc.), but this story is
  forgettable.  The music is largely mediocre, the graphics are dated, and
  the weapons do not reflect their real life counterparts in damage/control,
  but the gameplay is such that these problems detract very little from the fun
  (yes, this includes the narrator's voice).

  Endure the moderate learning curve and you may find an enjoyable
  deterrent from ordinary (read: well-coded) shooters.

  Begin a message with "^(number value 0-9)" without the quotes to change
  the color of the proceeding text.

  [Example]
  ^1My 'hp' was red.
  In the above example the whole phrase, "My 'hp' was red.", would be in red
  colored text.

  ^9My 'hp' was ^1red^9.
  In this second example "My 'hp' was" would appear in white colored text
  while "red" appeared in red colored text.  The period would be colored
  white.

  Color/Number chart:

  Etiquette                                       IV0
=====================================================

  Whether you decide to be an ass or not is up to you of course, but I find
  that there is a correlation between being an ass and being kicked out of
  the game.

  1.  Prioritize your bandwidth towards the game to minimize lag between
  you and the other players.
  2.  Do not type in a match if you are not willing to risk being killed in
  the process.
  3.  Do not type-kill unless the typing player does so deliberately to
  interfere with the match flow.
  4.  Rejoin matches that the majority of players want to keep going.
  Early rejoining is suggested as to give the others a chance to /kick those
  unwilling to rejoin.
  5.  Adhere to the game room's 'house rules' if applicable (should be
  written in game room title).
  6.  Adhere to any prearranged rules between you and your opponent.
  7.  Do not attack opponents bowing before combat.  Give some form of
  acknowledgement (returning the bow is the most widely accepted form of
  acknowledgement and respect)
  8.  Do not speak falsely about a player to get a votekick accepted (ie
  saying someone hacks because you don't like him)

=====================================================
  General Strategy                                VI0
=====================================================
GunZ requires a certain amount of strategy (assuming your opponent is at
all competent).  Don't worry though; if you can't dazzle them with brilliance
them baffle them with bull****. Best luck...


  ======
  Aiming  VI0a
  ======
  Aiming is probably the most important skill to develop, but it can also
  be the most difficult (yes, it can be more difficult than learning to
  dbfhhrs+ or whatever crazy steps people are coming up with nowadays) because
  of the factors involved.  There are three main things to consider while 
  taking aim. First, where your bullets are going to go.  Second, what your 
  opponent is doing.  Third, where your opponent actually is.

  Where your bullets go will greatly affect what your bullets hit.  Go by
  where your crosshair is aimed (should you choose to use a visible one)
  and not where your gun barrel is pointing.

  Observe what your opponent is doing and try to anticipate his next few
  steps. If you don't know what he's doing then you don't know where he's
  going, and if you don't know where he's going you will not know how much to 
  lead.

  Finally, consider your opponent's ping and make your best guess at where
  he actually will be when you fire or strike. This is a lot like what you
  considered previously only a few steps ahead of that to compensate for
  lag.
  ========
  Spamming  VI0b
  ========
  If you have a lagging opponent that you know is low on hp then you may
  want to practice "spamming".  Fire whatever weapons you have as rapidly as
  you can in that opponent's general direction and pray something hits.  There
  are situations where it would behoove you to grab your nades and unload all
  you got on the crowds' faces.

  It is important to note that the difference between spamming and firing
  in quick succession is the precision of your aim.
  =======
  Evading  VI0c
  =======
  Although it is possible to have a fair amount of success in Gunz with
  minimal evasion (mostly due to others incompetence in aiming), learning
  to evade often expands Gunz' otherwise limited gameplay.

  Always keep in mind that the more you are evading the less you are
  attacking (even with such techniques as slashshot).  Consequently, it is
  important to adjust the balance according to the opponent(s) you are 
  fighting.
  =============
  Massive Stike  VI0d
  =============
  Oh boy, unfortunately its not as simple as unleashing a massive strike on
  someone's face and unloading your smg's.  The angle at which your
  opponent is facing will determine whether your massive strike connects or
  not.  Thus you must make your best judgement at what angle to throw your 
  massive strike according to which angle you think your opponent will assume.

  If you happen to be the one getting massived you will be fortunate to be
  caught in a dash.  These will cause you to be stunned while sliding and will
  make you less vulnerable to pb's and instakills.

  If you believe your opponent is about to throw a massive strike, you
  should change your angle of view according to how you think your opponent
  will face. I believe there are more in-depth faqs about MS'ology so it might
  behoove you to do a bit of study and experiment.

  Sacrifice Items
  ===============
  These items are basically monster drops that you pick up from treasure
  chests.  Some combinations will make boss battles accessible.

  Goblin Doll
  A Goblin Doll, seems goblins like playing with dolls...

  Steak
  Very delicious looking steak.  It must have been the Goblin's favorite.

  Seasoned Meat
  Cooked seasoned meat.  Looks very delicious.

  Raw Meat
  Raw meat of an unknow(in-game typo?) animal.  It seemed to have been used
  as food.

  Small Skull
  Mysterious Skull.  It looks like it is a skull of a bird.

  Goblin Skull
  This unique item was found in a Goblin's cave.  An inscription on the
  back reads "Fight for a new world".

=====================================================
  Move Cancels                                  VIII0
=====================================================

A move cancel is an action that ends the preceding action before said preceding
action would finish if left alone

Slash -| Block
Lift (with sword) -| Block
Gunshot -| Reload
Dash -| Slash
Dash -| Lift/Hang (useful for moving while charged with massive strike)
Reload -| Weapon/Item switch
Massive charge -| Weapon/Item switch
Weapon/Item switch -| Weapon/Item switch
Standing reload -| Emotion (i.e. /bow) [note this only cancels reload
animation; gun still reloads; no free movement]

=====================================================
  Universal Tech                                  IX0
=====================================================

  These are techniques that can be performed with any melee weapon.

JSD
===
Jump->Shoot->Melee switch->Dash
Logically named, simply performed, and very effective technique to mix into
a battle for a little variety.  However, the move lacks a slash and therefore
lacks the chance to stun the opponent before firing the shot (such as
techniques branching from SS)

JSD Lightstep
=============
Jump->Shoot->Melee switch->Dash->Slash/Stab->Dash

Reload Shot (RS)
================
Fire-|Reload-|Weapon switch->Fire

This glitch is perhaps the most revolutionary thing to happen to GunZ since
the first k-style steps.  It wasn't so much the step itself but merely the fact
that gun delay can be cancelled with a reload which made everything quicker
and allowed for all new techniques that would be impossible otherwise.

Tumble Shot
===========
Tumble->Fire

Lightstep
=========
Jump->Dash->Slash (or stab)->Dash
This step is handy for navigating around the map; especially useful with
dagger.  Can be used for climbing walls.

Double Lightstep
================
Dash->Jump->Slash/Stab)->Dash->Slash/Stab->Dash

Double Grenade Throw
====================
Throw last grenade->Throw grenade from next set
Note: You must have two different sets of grenades for this to work.  The
first grenade you throw must be the last grenade of item 2 slot, and you must
have at least one grenade left from the grenade set of item 1 slot. Press fire
rapidly between grenade throws unless you can figure out the timing.

This move is excellent for small areas where groups of enemies tend to
gather. Dodging two grenades in two different places is a little more difficult
then dodging one grenade at a time.  Unfortunately, it can only be used once
per spawn because of the unique prerequisites.

Spawn Shot
==========
Die (with gun out)->Fire before respawn
This may or may not have been patched.  This will fire in the vicinity of
your death; not your respawn point.


=====================================================
  K-style                                          X0
=====================================================

  K-style is primarily used with a sword by preference, but the techniques
  can be done with kodachis.  Note: Steps with an 'R' preceding the
  abbreviation is just that step combined with reload and extra shot (i.e.
  'RSS' = 'SS'+reload->switch->shoot).

 ========================
 Offensive/Defensive Tech  X0a
 ========================

Slashshot (SS/Full Step)
========================
Jump->Dash->Slash(hold firing button)-|Weapon switch->Fire (happens after
landing)
Note: In old iGunZ days slashshot was referred to as 'million step' when
performed with an automatic.

This move was like the proest thing you could do back in early igunz days,
and a lot of people may still hold a special place in their hearts for this
move. Throw in a reload at the end of the move and you have a technique that
stands the test of time.

Uses: This technique has a dash, a slash, and a fire. Any one of those is
useful alone, but the beautiful thing is being able to stun the opponent
for a split second with the slash while delivering a pointblank shot.

Butterfly (BF)
==============
Jump->Dash->Slash-|Block

This is another move of now legendary status, and can be imagined as the
second root from which many k-style techniques are branched (the first being
SS)

Uses: Evasion, offense, and defense all within a split second. Very
spammable and very easy to mix into a battle.

Double Butterfly (DBF)
======================
Jump->Slash-|Block->Slash-|Block
*Add a dash before the second slash as desired.

This has mostly become the new standard for butterfly spammers.  While not
as useful as butterfly for closing in distance, dbf makes up for that with its
excellent trapping capabilities.

Butterfly Slashshot
===================
Jump->Slash-|Block->Dash->Slash-|Weapon switch->Fire

Two of the greatest k-style moves all in one technique!  Too bad its not as
useful as either move by itself...

Uses: Could be used in the middle of a dbf trap to mix things up.

Butterfly Halfstep
==================
Jump->Slash-|Block->Dash->Slash-|Weapon switch->Fire->Melee switch-|Dash

Butterfly Half Halfstep
=======================
Jump->Slash-|Block->Dash->Slash-|Weapon switch-|Melee
switch->Land->Jump->Weapon switch->Dash with gun(hold fire)->Gun will fire

JSD Flashstep
=============
Jump->Shoot->Melee switch->Dash->Slash-|Weapon switch-|Melee switch->Dash

Should you decide to gain more distance after a JSD, this move will allow
you to do so.

Halfstep (HS)
=============
Jump->Dash->Slash (hold firing button)-|Weapon switch->Dash (Gun will fire
while in air)

Many people use this exclusively from the slashshot branch of techniques.
It allows more air time, more dodge, and more time to aim.  However this also
results in more time before you can start your next move.

JSD Halfstep
============
Dash->Jump->Weapon switch->Fire-|Reload->Melee switch->Dash->Slash-|Weapon
switch->Fire-|Reload-|Melee switch->Dash

Double Halfstep
===============
Dash->Jump->Slash-|Weapon switch->Fire-|Reload-|Melee
switch->Dash->Slash-|Weapon switch->Fire-|Reload-|Melee switch->Dash

As cool as this technique looks it's very situational. This will not
replace your standard slashshot or halfstep.

Half Halfstep (HHS)
===================
Jump->Dash->Slash-|Weapon switch-|Melee switch->Land->Jump->Weapon
switch->Dash with gun (hold fire)->Gun will fire

You're moving around dodging with flashstep or quickswitch and you see an
open shot.  Throw in the last part of the move onto your quickswitch and you
have your hhs.

 =================
 Navigational Tech  X0b
 =================

Voidstep
========
Dash->Slash-|Block
This tech was made popular, if not developed, by a player named Vampirella
(cloudstrife8 on the boards).

Quickswitch
===========
Jump->Dash->Slash-|Weapon switch-|Melee switch
Great for climbing walls.

Flashstep (FS)
==============
Jump->Dash->Slash-|Weapon switch-|Melee switch->Dash

This should usually be your primary means of navigating the map.  It's
quick, it has great evasion, and for what its worth, a slash.

Double Flashstep
================
Jump->Dash->Slash-|Weapon switch-|Melee switch->Dash->Slash-|Weapon
switch-|Melee switch->Dash

Butterfly Lightstep
===================
Jump->Slash-|Block->Dash->Slash->Dash

May be used for close proximity trapping.

Butterfly Flashstep
===================
Jump->Slash-|Block->Dash->Slash-|Weapon switch-|Melee switch->Dash

May be used for close proximity trapping.

=====================================================
  D-style                                         XI0
=====================================================

  D-style is short for dagger-style.  The style is composed of universal
  techs and dagger exlusive techs.  The dagger exclusive techs are the ones
  that will be covered here.

Ghost Lunge
===========
Lunge with path to opponent obstructed
The lunge will still connect even though the animation and your sprite do
not. Does not work with most obstructions so you will have to play around with
it.

Dash Stab
=========
Dash-|Stab
I believe this is pretty straight forward, but this is effective due to the
dagger's quick stab and recovery.

Dagger Slashshot
================
Jump->Dash->Stab (hold fire)->Jump off wall->Weapon switch->Gun will fire
Slashshotting with a dagger requires the use of a wall.  Adding reload shot
is, of course, optional.

=====================================================

=====================================================
  =======================
  Attack and Defend Rooms  XIV0a
  =======================
  These games are usually in team deathmatch rooms, but can also be played
  in assination mode.  In 'attack and defend' (or simply 'ATK and DEF') games,
  one team stays and guards their spawn area while the other team attacks
  them.  The attacking and defending teams alternate by round (unless
  another alternation sequence is arranged).
  =========
  Bow Duels  XIV0b
  =========
  Bow duels are simply games in which each player bows (/bow or /salute
  command) to the other before engaging combat.
  Bow duels are almost exclusively 1v1.
  ===========
  Insta Duels  XIV0c
  ===========
  Insta Duels are battles in each player takes turns attempting to
  instakill the other.  Turns alternate after each instakill attempt.
  ===============
  Region Specific  XIV0d
  ===============
  Region specific rooms will have an area of the world indicated on the
  game room title.  This area will either indicate whether players from that
  part of the world are welcome in that game or are to keep out of that game
  (depending on whether a word such as 'only' follows or a word such as 'no'
  preceeds). Kicking is usually decided based on player pings.

=====================================================

  =================
  Recording replays  XV0a
  =================
  To initiate a recording, press the f11 key while in play.  A message
  stating that the recording has started will appear in the chat box (assuming
  the chat box is not toggled off).  The replay recording will end
  automatically afterthe game ends or manually by pressing the f11 key a
  second time. Leaving the game room before the game ends or ending the replay 
  manually will result in a blank replay file.  The completed replay will by 
  default be saved in your Documents->Gunz->Replay folder as a '.gzr' file.

  Warning: Do not initiate replay before the start of the first round or
  during the transitions between rounds.  This may cause an incomplete
  replay or corrupt file.

  ===============
  Viewing replays  XV0b
  ===============
  To view a replay file, go to the lobby screen and move your cursor over
  the 'Replay' button on the bottom-left (somewhere below your character
  information).  A menu containing the contents of your replay folder
  should appear on the screen. You should see something like:

                 This will be the   Gunz000.gzr  V3   Gunz001.gzr  V3
                                    Gunz002.gzr  V4

  Select the replay you would like to view.

  Replay Controls:
                    Left Click  - Change player to spectate
                    Right Click - Toggle player-view/free-view
                    M           - Toggle between different views

  Frequently Asked Questions                    XVII0
=====================================================

  Why am I not doing damage to my opponent when my hit counter says 'HIT'?
  There are a few explanations for such a phenomenon.
  1. Your opponent is 'lagged out'.  Your first hint that this is the case
  is the red lag symbol over your enemy's head.  The ping with that player
  should read '999'.  Data is not reaching both parties because of this
  problem in connection.
  2. Your opponent may actually be a few actions ahead of what appears on
  your screen as a result of lag between the two computers.
  3. Your opponent is using hacks that either lock his hp/ap or prevent
  your weapons from doing damage.

  How much bounty and exp do I get when I kill people?
  The exp you receive is determined by the enemies level and the map in
  which you're playing (note: your own level has an exp cap for how much exp
  you can receive).  The bounty you receive is calculated as 1.2x your 
  opponents level but will not exceed twice your level.

  What is my ping?
  Your ping is different from player to player, and can rise or fall
  depending on either players connection status, location, and connected
  internet activity (with any unit in the network).

  Does my starting class affect my stats?
  If by stats you mean hp and ap then no, your starting class does not
  affect your stats.  Damage is dealt according to the connecting weapon's
  damage statistic (there is no character stat that affects damage). Check
  'Equipment' section for more details.

  How do I put those funny symbols in my in-game name?
  These symbols can be typed with a special keyboard or a by holding alt
  and pressing a combination of keys from the numpad.  See a chart on ASCII
  code for a list of these number combinations.

  Is there a difference between male and female characters aside from the
  animation?
  Yes, male and female characters pull out there weapons from different
  angles although this really only affects the chance of hitting yourself with
  a rocket depending on your position relative to the ground/wall/object.
  The hit boxes and timing is the same for both male and female.

  How do I make a shower room dm or berserker game?
  At the time of this writing it is not yet possible to make one without
  the use of prohibited hacks and code manipulation.  It should also be noted
  that making a shower room dm or berserker in this fashion is a bannable
  offense.

  Why haven't you covered anything about efficient swapping, line swapping,
  etc.?
  The Ijji staff is against swapping.  Engaging in swapping will result in
  an exp lock or ban.

  Sometime when I first started playing GunZ around July/August 2005 I came
  across OoSomeone41oO's FAQ on GameFAQs along with some replay tutorials from
  various players (mostly from a player called Kraise). This enlightened me on
  some of the things I was seeing in-game, and the game changed for me
  forever.  I'd like to thank OoSomeone41oO and Kraise for their part in
  helping me advance in the game which consequently made it a lot more fun.

  I would also like to thank (most of) the GameFAQs GunZ board community for
  showing me a lighter side of the game when I had difficulty relating to the
  ever growing ego oriented GunZ community.
