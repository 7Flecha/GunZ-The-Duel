****NOTE****
Hey all, this is my first faq, so bear with me. Right now it's rough,
unpolished and needs reworking. I was going to do it all quickly, but
this project is proving a bit too difficult... so I'm putting up what
I have as of now and am going to fix it later. It needs a better index
and less abstraction, but you get the idea.

1. Introduction (C1)
****************************************************************************

GENERAL TACTICS and TERMINOLOGY

These are general, all purpose tactics that you will NEED to use to survive.
They are in order of how I deem them as important, but it isn't too harsh. You
could swap a few.


1. Manage your aggro and your "Tails" appropriately.

-What is a tail? 
Tails are any foe that is following you. At any given moment,
you have a tail. If you don't have a tail, great, but you almost always do. In
fact, I'm gonna say you always do because you should CONSIDER that you always
do. Generally the majority of your tail is soldiers, kings, or any type of
goblin. The good thing about tails is that they are dumb and without the
other enemies, you could probably dispatch them with a knife. Be wary of a 
fewthings though. Teammates can run into your tails, and you can run into 
yourteammates. Should you ever bump into a teammate, be fearful, because 
their tail is around. It could be half the enemies in the room for all 
you know, so regard bumping into teammates as a bad omen. Tails generally 
aren't a big problem unless you make a glaring mistake, like getting 
too carefree or getting  stunned/slowed/caught on a wall. Also, always 
recognize that you have a tail at all times, even if you aren't aware 
of it. Most of the time you have something homing in on you, even if 
you haven't seen it yet.

 -What is aggro?
Enemies that are looking to hurt you, rather than your buddy. If you are alone,
you've aggroed everything. Good job. Anything with a ranged attack should be
prioritized in your aggro list as high priority. Mages and Wizards especially.
How do you manage it? You stay aware of who's looking at you. If you see a
mage in front of you, and you are avoiding enemies, which way do you run? You
run away from the enemies following you and you never run at a straight line
toward a mage and you don't zig when you should zag. In fact, it's mostly 
better to simply keep working your way around mages or wizards rather than go
left then right or right then left. They don't "lead" you when they fire, so 
you might end up just walking back into it.

*THE IMPORTANT PART*
Enemies "Aggro" the closest thing to them, always. If you're alone in the room
than everything is aiming at you, no matter what you're doing, since you're the
closest. Take this into account, because it means being alone multiplies your
problems.

If everyone else dies, every enemy in the room suddenly is aware of you and 
is actively moving towards you and is firing every ranged attack they can at 
you. Even that guy who isn't rendered in your screen is working towards you. 
If you see 20 arrows fly by, generally it means your buddy has succumbed and 
now all those mages who savegely tore him apart, are now looking to crucify 
you,  long range style. Start doing circles and running perpendicular to their 
firing pattern. Even if you just know generally where they are, start doing 
a big circle.

2. Using Butterfly or the Dagger, or, how I learned to love my melee weapons.

Butterflying is a bit harder to do but will cause more damage with this trick,
and dagger is easier but riskier.

Every enemy you face has one big weakness. They don't attack horizontally. That
means if they are facing you within a 45 degree angle, they usually can't hurt
you. Not only can they not hurt you, they won't attempt to. This leads to a fun
little trick you should practice in mansion, and perfect in dungeon.

*DAGGER ONLY*
Get a substantial tail, draw your dagger. Strafe right or left, but swing your
mouse the opposite direction. For instance if you strafe right, look left.
Strafe left, look right. Most people strafe right and look left because it's 
easier. Start doing a circle around your enemies, adjusting for their 
"shuffling ranks". Stay mid range for your dagger but keep swinging. They won't
hurt you (especially goblins) and there isn't much they can do to you. This
works well with guns as well, when you are in small quarters and want to keep
yourself away from other enemies. It isn't fullproof, a stun or a missed swing
can still connect, but generally you'll just outwalk them. Kings you have to
move a bit faster for, and the boss a LOT faster, but generally you can kill
anything doing this. Just remember to stay calm, walk and not dash (it's 
possible to get them a little crazy dashing too much) and just keep slashing.

The trick is to stay calm and beware of people behind you. If you walk
constantly without slowing down, you'll be outside their attack range and if
they try to initiate a swing or a slice, it won't have been started until you
are outside it's horizontal reach.

*Short Version*
Think of a clock. The enemies are the center of the clock. You rotate around
the outside and as long as you stay in front of the hands, you'll be ok. The
enemies attack in straight lines, like hands. Stay in front of the hand and
move slowly but continuously and you'll be able to melee indefinitely. Always
be 10-15 minutes ahead of the hand and you'll be fine.

It works on mages too, but I don't reccomend getting close or they will swipe
and that move is fast enough to catch you. Mages are evil like that. However
it works extremely well with guns and large groups of mages. Hold the trigger
and don't get dizzy doing circles.

In time this trick becomes second nature and you'll use it in fragments to 
deadly effect.

as for butterflying... see an advanced guide. I can't do it justice and it's
very difficult, but rewarding.

3. Using Melee weapons in more dire circumstances.

Sometimes that Dagger trick won't work so well. There are mages scattered 
around or superion is breathing down your neck. If you have a dagger or a sword
you can simply dash, jump, slash the edge of a group, then keep doing hit and
run passes. It's riskier but when you've got nothing you might get lucky. If
you can butterfly, great, but most people can't. With a dagger you can 
continuously strike repeatedly as you pass by, doing triangles around your 
foes. Generally just jumping to the outside of a group and skimming the outside
is best, jumping through the middle is tricky (but sometimes neccesary). Just
remember to not committ to a full on attack. Your trying to stay alive more 
than you are trying to do damage. It's too easy to get in close and then get
swatted repeatedly, rather than get in and out clean with some enemies damaged.

4. Don't Neglect Your Grenades.
It's easy to forget you have 8 grenades. Get used to using them frequently and
whatever you do, don't save them until the end. Whenever you get an opportunity
send a nade out there. They do more damage than you think. Try dropping one
grenade between your legs sometime to see, at full health, and it'll nearly 
kill you. You can also get headshots with grenades. You can use them against 
the boss as well and if you are good at pooling enemies, you can farm enemies 
while still hurting the boss.

They also are a great alternative to using your Dagger. Generally avoiding
using your melee weapons is choice because it isn't as risky.

5. Don't Forget What You're Here For - GRAB THE CHEST!
It's easy to forget. You're here for Large Skulls more than anything else. When
you kill a King, make sure to CHECK to see if it dropped a chest. Never forget
this.

6. Making a Rooms.
When you make a room, you should make it descriptive.

Dungeon Lvl 3, be 25+ or Kick.
Dungeon Lvl 2, be 13+ or Kick.

I know you don't like kicking, no one does. But you have to. You can't enter
Dungeon levels with characters under the limits. You don't have to explain it
to them. If they ask, tell them to go to www.gamefaqs.com/ and learn something.

7. Momentum Jumping
Ever notice sometimes you have trouble stopping after a jump? You'll notice it
a lot when you are on steps. Your character will slide and you'll momentarily
lose control of everything except jumping again. This is something both to be
aware of, and to utilize.

The instant you land, your character slides a bit. You slide a bit more if you
dashed before you landed. It's small, but it's enough to put some distance
between you and everything else. Whenever you are in tight spaces, you should
be continuously jumping. You get slightly more speed and that moment you are
in the air, is a moment you are safe. It'll also disrupt mages aiming at you
from afar, and may cause them to miss. Combined with dashing and other aerial
maneuvers, you can evade and move much faster. You are forced to account for
momentum jumping, so it is wise to utilize it when you are the ground, and 
cheat it when you are in the air.

Should you fall victim to a mistimed momentum jump (say while fleeing an enemy
on some steps), don't panic, draw your melee, jump again, slice and dash to 
freedom. It will become second nature and will certainly save you a lot of
time and effort.

8. Aim Low
That's right, don't aim for the head. This was something I learned early on
that made much more energy efficient. You can aim for the head, but you'll 
miss with a lot of your shots. In fact, certain enemies you can aim just above 
the nose and miss everytime. Aim for the waist to leg area and you'll hit 
much more. The exception is when you are using pistols, but good luck with
that. Mages you should definitely hit just where the robe starts to work its
way inwards.

****************************************************************************
2. Equipment (C2)
****************************************************************************

Ah, my favorite section.

Equipment for Quest Mode is simpler than you'd think. There are a lot of 
choices you are forced to make in this mode that you aren't in normal fighting. 
Fighting against live people is dynamic and unsystematic. However in Quest 
mode it is very clear cut - there are weapons that are clearly better designed
for killing hordes. I'm going to discuss pros and cons of all weapons then 
I'm going to address what you should have, regardless. Also there are some 
tactics in here that may benefit your PvP game.

**Great Tip**
Don't be afraid to double up.
Like AR's? Bring 2. Fighting the boss, concerned about ammo? Bring 2 machine 
guns. Sound ludicrous? It shouldn't. This gets greatly overlooked, so I felt
the need to put it right at the top. I used two AR's from 18 on, with great
success.

The ONE thing you have to keep in mind regarding this trick - You CAN'T hold
two of the same MODEL weapon. For instance, you can't bring two level 18
maxwells. HOWEVER you can bring the level 18 Maxwell, and the Nico R6 assault 
rifle. This... is a great trick that often gets glazed over.

Armor + Accessories
HP Rings. There is nothing better. Most of the time you'll have armor left
when you die. Armor is nowhere near as important as HP. Buy them as soon as you
can. +18 hp is almost 20% more life and that means more often than not when
the going gets rough, you'll still have a safety net. Your armor barely ever
runs out and since the power ups are scattered around, you might as well get
them there. However you are always losing HP and 20% more life is HUGE when
you think about it. After you put them on, next time you are in a round down
to your tiny life, realize that normally you'd be dead now. Also take into 
account this - normally, when you die, you have armor left. Also some people
will say buy the 20,000 dollar better HP rings at 30, but for +4 hp, the
additional 4 pounds of weight could be better used holstering 4 grenades.
Speaking of grenades....

Grenades
Bring as many as you can carry. I can't praise this enough. When the going gets
rough or when opportunity strikes, grenades are a safe simple alternative to
your main weapons. They do much more damage than the rocket launchers and you
can carry a lot of them. 8 pounds and you can kill a large mob easy. They
really come in handy when you're alone. Very naturally you'll learn to pool
your enemies for the kill. The trick is to learn to throw them correctly so
they land exactly where you want them to. Once you do, they'll easily soften
up any mob. I highly, highly reccomend this technique because it'll maximize
your damage potential. Keep this in mind - one grenade equals one pound. If you
buy a bunch of grenades then you can always use them to max your weight. I 
also actively make space for grenades and never like to leave home without 4
even on the low levels. Also when you've burnt all your ammo and you are down
to your knife or sword, it sure beats taking the risk and if you get lucky you
can easily score some ammo powerups. Don't second guess this one, just get used
to it.

**Grenade Tricks and Tips**

-Throwing
One thing to keep in mind when throwing a grenade. Depending on which way you
are moving when you throw a grenade, will change it's path. For instance if you
are backpeddling, the grenade will be much closer to you. If you are moving
forward you'll throw the grenade with more force and it'll end up away from
you. Try to keep in mind what direction your pitching it. Often times you can
creep one around a corner like this.
                  + 
                 + +
                    __++   
                   /  \  ++
                   \__/     ++    (+=path and detonation)                       

  (where you end up)*<-------- -* (You as you begin your throw)

-Dropping
My favorite tactic for dealing with trails. Backpeddle, look at the group. If
you've got some clearance, draw a nade, be sure to be moving backwards, look at
the ground and throw your nade. It will bounce, roll a bit with you, then stop
dead. You'll have maybe two seconds to get away from it, so continue
backpeddling. The group will walk right on top of it and into ideal position.
This trick works great for when you're farming under difficult conditions, like
bosses, and allows you to focus on evasion, with a bit of at twist.

-On steps
If you are running up a set of steps, keep this in mind. If you throw a grenade
directly at a set of steps, they'll hit the steps as if they hit a wall. If you
are fleeing up a set of steps, recklessly throw a grenade in front of you. It
will hit the steps, end up well behind you, where enemies following you are 
waiting. If you run past some mages, it's a great parting shot. It also may
disrupt mages as it tosses them around.

-Bouncing
When you throw a grenade the first bounce will make it fly uncontrollably far.
The best way to avoid this is to pitch it downwards at 45 degrees or less. By
controlling the first bounce you can effectively throw grenades at closer
ranges and not have them bounce too far. This works especially well in the
stair level of dungeons, since you'll be fighting from a height for a while.

HP + Armor Kits
I'd say these are pretty much useless. Generally they are only going to come in
handy when you are absolutely alone, which is the worst time to use them. More
often than not you are better off keeping to the offense and letting your
enemies drop HP + Ammo + Armor. It's hard enough to grab the health when it's
made available to you, let alone stop, drop and pickup. The worst part, they 
are abnormally heavy which will kill your weapon selections.

Some people pray by them, especially people who butterfly. If that is the case
then I praise your talent, but I still don't reccomend it to the average
player. If you know enough about the game to survive like that, you'll know
enough to violate my guide when your supposed to.

Sword VS Dagger

The big debate. Swords are clearly better (shocker) BUT not neccesarily
better for you. Can you butterfly? Do you even know what I'm talking about?

If you are shaky in your butterfly and you sword skills, don't bring a sword. 
You can use the extra weight to carry more grenades and then you'll focus
on evasion. Only the skilled know how to appropriately block attacks and
set up for using a sword. If you aren't so well versed with a sword I highly
reccomend just skipping it and going dagger. Blocking is great, but much more
difficult in this mode rather than in normal combat. In normal combat twelve
guys aren't swinging at you at once (unless, well, you did something to annoy
that many people).

I don't reccomend using the secondary attack on the dagger. It'll get you
killed unceremoniously. Others will laugh or get pissed at you for being a
N00b. You might get away with using the sword knock-up, but I don't think
it'll save you any trouble and it's still risky.

Let your own skill be your guide. With the dagger, once you learn to evade
properly you can tag enemies and actually kill things when you've run out of
ammunition, but with a sword you can block and survive much longer.
Personally, I use a Dagger. I WISH I was as good with a sword as all those
K-Stylers and people who can repeatedly block boss attacks, but I just 
assume not take the risk because honestly, I'm not that good yet. Keep in
mind though that a sword can do everything a dagger can if you are skilled
with it but it also can hinder you greatly if you are not skilled with it.
You'll take more hits trying to block rather than evade and it'll slow your
game down. 
Sprayers are king. Generally they provide more ammo, firepower and speed of
kills than any other weapons. They also come with much more ammo.

Assault Rifles
Honestly I've had more success with the lvl 18 rifle (the Walcom) than any
other weapon. I can't praise it enough. It's got a high rate of fire, you get
it at 18 and will use it forever. Also assault rifles get great ammo 
efficiency because they are extremely good at mid range attacks and the 
Walcom gets one very cool benefit. It'll literally push mages away from you
(alloying two more seconds of crucial attack if your rushing by one). I carried
two assault for a while and was very pleased with. The only major flaw that I
found was that, as is such with many weapons, refilling its ammo is extremely
difficult. Also rifles come with an extremely large amount of ammo in the form
of extra clips and often times you won't reach the bottom before a normal 
round is over. Be wary of one thing though - newer rifles are not always better
than old. The Walcom at 18 is by far the best rifle in overall stats. It never
left my set up after 18.

The big combatant to Assault Rifles is revolvers. Generally the unholy
triumvirite is Machine Guns, Rifles and Revolvers. Pick any two or double up
on any one. However of the choices I'd say Revolvers are the advanced choice
and the Rifles the easier, more friendly, choice compared to the revolvers. You
can kill efficiently with both but the revolvers might edge out should you use
swapshot or reload shot effectively. However most people don't so sticking with
the Maxwell is definitely choice.

Shotguns
Low ammo efficiency, low ammo, you have to be close to utilize. Yada, yada,
yada, you get the idea.

GREAT for PVP. Bad for quest.

They do have efficient damage though at times, so if you're stuck with one,
make sure to maximize the damage you get out of them when you need to.

SMG's
Very good early on. The beginning SMG's are much lighter than their later
counterparts (or at least you have less to strap on) and these provide good
damage dealing. Coupled with an AR you have a strong combination and efficient
firepower till your 18. Also SMG's come with more ammo which is great. There is
a drawback though. As you get higher in levels you'll notice the weight of the
SMG's more and more and eventually they'll become too cumbersome to use. Also
they are not ammo efficient (at least not nearly as well as the AR's are) and
you'll start to notice it greatly as you get better. However they are great in
the beginning.

Oh and never get a single uzi, ever. Slow down with 2 and it's like having
double the firepower without a decrease in ammo. If you need accuracy, make
your alternate a pistol or an AR.

However, once you reach 18 these become fairly useless. They still are good,
just not as good as your alternative choices. Revolvers take out the need for
an alternative as well as doubling up on AR's.

Pistols / Moreso Revolvers
I don't reccomend automatics. You need to be able to spit death and automatics
will slow you down. The revolvers are "ok". They are a stellar light weapon 
however and are great when you have constraints on what you can carry. If you
like using SMG's they are a great couplement because the revolvers will give
you solid range. However ammo constraints cripple them greatly and practically
waste an ammo power up. Generally pistols aren't that great though, if you are
going to use them, make sure to have a primary weapon that is ammo efficient
because pistols, once emptied, should stay empty.

The upside to pistols is this. The ;ater revolvers are fantastic, as a late
blooming weapon pistols are great. You can also aim at specific parts of
enemies anatomy in hopes of scoring more damage, but I've found that incredibly
difficult given the games damage allocation per body part. I have heard these
weapons are very effective, but I've never thought they edged out over the
Maxwell. Also the revolvers accuracy is unquestionable making them an effective
ranged death dealer. Later on in your characters life, the revolvers will be
able to annihilate most any type of foe within the 6 shots made available per
reload.

I did some more research into the hows and why's of Pistols and I came up with
this. During the boss fight they don't get many advantages that you're looking
for, so the choice of revolver or assault rifle is ambiguous. You can go either
way.

However there is one thing that makes revolvers a unique choice. For those of
you who are advanced Gunz players, you may know of two techniques called 
"swap shot" and "reload shot". These take the cooldown off the revolvers
allowing them to be fired much faster than normal, making them true death
dealers. However if you do not use these techniques the revolvers lose a bit of
their edge. They are good choice if you know how to use them, but my personal
preference is still the Maxwell AR. Let yourself experiment with both and 
decide for yourself.

Rocket Launchers
I'm mixed when it comes to these. I have to say I use the Nico
Machine Gun much more because you can solidly eliminate enemies to farm more
ammo as well as directly hurt the boss. The damage is also very lackluster 
when an actual grenade does double the damage. They also don't get a ton of
starting ammo. However they can be used effectively, but make SURE to herd
your enemies into a tight group or else your wasting your ammo. It'd be best
to start farming ammo right when you start using it and keep that mentality of
keeping your ammo high and flowing. Also the reduced speed is something you 
have to learn to manage effectively.

If you are going to use a Rocket Launcer, keep this in mind. The damage isn't
as high as a normal grenade, so you have to use its one major strength
edgewise. This weapon does about 50 damage. The level 28 revolver does nearly
the same damage. What's the difference?

The Rocket Launcher can hit entire mobs.

Thinking of it this way, you manage to hit, say, in a gloriously well groomed
shot, 10 people, that's 50 damage x 10 people. That's 500 damage. You need to
exploit this, because the Rocket Launcher does not get a lot of ammo and if you
are gonna kill anything, you need to kill EVERYTHING. I also reccomend aiming
at the ground at the enemies feet rather than the enemy itself.

Machine Guns
At 25, this is a great investment. It's got fairly substantial power and it
really will help your performance during the boss fight. Also if you properly
manage ammo powerups you can keep firing for a long time. I used this and the
Walcom steadily after 25 and I never regretted it. It greatly adds to your 
longevity as a fighter since one ammo upgrade gives you half your total ammo
for that weapon back. It's a great boss killer and the best for ammo
efficiency. The one reccomendation I have is that you bring something that is
a bit faster on the kill, because if you see a wizard or a mage that needs to
go this won't kill them with any haste.

Also doubling up on this one isn't such a bad idea. Keep in mind you can't buy
two of the same Machine Guns, but you can buy two different models and hold
both. This is a nice trick for the boss since ammo is so scarce.

Armor
Generally as a rule of thumb, I bought the lighter armor. This is because as
far as armor goes, I don't think I ever ran out of armor before I ran out of
health. So I went light and I removed my gloves because 5 ap in the grand 
scheme of things was paltry compared to running out of ammo. What killed me
more, running out of ammo or running out of armor? Did I ever run out of armor?
No, I didn't, I died with plenty armor left.

3. Quest Mode Items (C3)
****************************************************************************

This is the part that confuses everybody. Most people pick these things up
through trial and error but when you're a n00b, there's no way you can know
what to do with the items you're getting.

Here's the rundown of the basic items you'll need.

Torn Page 13.

Activates level 2 when it's used alone. You can buy them in the store for 
100 bucks. The catch is you have to be 13 or higher to enter or to use one.

Torn Page 25.
Activates level 3 when it's used alone. You can buy them in the store for
500 bucks. The catch is you have to be 25 or higher to enter or to use one.

Torn Page 41.
Activates level 4 when it's used alone. You can buy them in the store for
1000 bucks. The catch is you have to be 41 or higher to enter or to use one.

Torn Page 65.
These I have little experience with, but I presume that they activate level
5 when activated and I've heard they can only be dropped, not bought.

**IMPORTANT SUM UP OF PAGES**
You can't be in a room that's using a page # that's higher than you're level
#. If a room kicks you, they should be just beating you to the "quit" button.
To use a page, drag and drop it. You'll see the level change and that's about
it. There isn't any other combinations, despite all the items you'll be 
getting. Oh, well, except for this one. Also, it won't work if you try to mix
it up with anything else. So don't.

Large Skull + Skeleton = SUPERION THE TAINTED
'Nuff said. Oh and you get Large Skulls from Kings. Skeletons dolls, everywhere
else.

****************************************************************************
4. Levels
****************************************************************************

DUNGEON LEVELS

LEVEL 1
Easy. If you can't beat this one, you just need practice.

LEVEL 2
This one's a bit more tricky. You still need just practice mainly, but here's
some quick tips. When you get to the stage with the staircase, immediately get
to the staircase at the other end as fast as possible. In doing so, you allow
yourself the only place in this entire area you are allowed to stop at, while
also utilizing the only point where you can defend from almost all the spawn
points (minus the one is right on that platform). I advise not lingering to
long on it should it be overwhelmed. Instead if it gets flooded, leave, then
immediately return. They'll get stuck on the way back up and you can do this
indefinitely.

LEVEL 3
This one is composed of 5 stages. On a side note, from the Wizards you
may pick up a Mysterious Skull.

Stage 1
You'll recognize this as stage 2 from Level 2. It has more enemies. This one
is easy and if it isn't, you need to downgrade or practice harder. It is so
easy after a while you'll die of boredom. Literally you'll just kill and kill
until your health runs out and you won't care anymore. If you see someone die
they are either bored, having a bad run, or is a n00b. Usually its the former.
If it isn't, you'll know because they'll get uppity about it.

Stage 2
This one is harder because it is comprised of only mages and soldiers. Use
the stairway tactic again, but be prepared to abandon it should you get 
overrun. Take into account your teams weaponry and act accordingly. Try to
stay in this area as long as possible as the amount of mages in this level is
astounding and you are in the best possible place to defeat them. Be more aware
that the mages coming up the steps in the middle are going to be aiming at you.
You'll quickly realize that standing too far to the left will get you pummeled
and that you need to be aware of it. Dodging is more important this time around
and generally you'll need to have this level down solid to win.

**Special Tactic (from earlier)**
Remember, you can't fall off. At the start dash to the end of the level, and
wall run or slash cancel your way up the wall to the top of the steps. This is
the only place in the entire level that provides cover. Also enemies will 
become lodged on the stairs below in abundance. Mages especially will be snared
by this. You can also back up on the steps while looking down, to provide cover
where your shots go over the steps and the enemies arrows hit them. You can 
also avoid mage homing balls by simply backing up and letting them be destroyed
by the steps. Soldiers will get caught but will eventually break free. You can
attempt to annihilate them before they reach you, but be ready to clear out.
Depending on enemies you can either just fall to the bottom of the wall and
immediately run back up (the enemies will see that your below them, run down
the steps while you run up, the second your feet touch the top steps, they'll
run back up... but get stuck on the stairs again). If the area is too crowded
however, I suggest going into melee, leaping off the wall and dashing to the
other end of the stage, killing any opportunities you run across, then running
IMMEDIATELY back. This will resort the enemies and allow you to easily dispatch
the remaining foes.

Stage 3
This one is much more difficult than previous levels. It becomes crowded very 
quickly and even the skilled can be toppled here by one bad mistake. Humble
yourself here - if you get low on health, stop being the center of attention.
Be careful of bad edges of the stage as they can be decieving and there is
one glitched wall. The glitched wall will cause you a lot of trouble and will
probably get you killed once or twice. I reccomend relying on your grenades at
the choke point in the center and to work together with your teammates. As a
rule most stages you are better off fighting for yourself and away from your
friends but in this one you have to be aware of your team. If you are bumping
into someone at the center you need to clear out of there. If you are all 
hiding on one end of the stage you should take the initiative. Whatever you do,
don't keep a long trail of enemies behind you for too long. It won't effect
you, but one of your teammates will eventually find it and get themselves hurt.
This level is a free for all though and there isn't much you can do to prepare.

Stage 4
You should know this stage pretty well as it's basically the same but with an
abundance of enemies now. More of everything, including Kings. The golden rule
of this level is this.

Pick up the chests, without fail. You're here for those skulls!

The entire point of doing this is to get the boss level. You will learn to beat
this level with ease but will also forget to make sure to get the chests. It is
extremely important.

Keep on your toes and watch your back. If you run into a teammate get away fast
because he's got a tail. Focus, as always on this level, on the mages first and
foremost. If someone says "I'm killing the mages", great, say nothing and kill
the mages. It's your job to kill the mages, because it's everyones job. Once
you annihilate the mages, this level is smooth sailing (as long as you didn't
get stupid, sloppy, or bored and got tagged). You can afford to leave one or
two around and if you find you have a trail of ten soldiers, focus on them
simply because having too big of a tail is dangerous.

Stage 5
Wizards are top priority. Mages a close second. If surrounded by mages, just
keep moving and keep their attention - your buddies should be dwindling their
numbers fast. 15 seconds of holding the mages attention and probably your 
teammates have seriously done some damage. If you get slowed by the wizards,
drop whatever strategem you were working on, switch to melee and dash hard.
When it wears off, continue to dash to work yourself away from the enemies
that have gained on you. Keep your eyes peeled for Kings because they are once
again on the prowl. Luckily this level is small and you can get used to them,
but beware of spawns. If you haven't seen them and are wondering why, you 
should assume they are gonna spawn on top of you or have and are right behind
you. Be wary of one thing especially in this level - bumping into teammates
tails. You can get hit on swings meant for them, walk right into a mob by
backpeddling or simply get confused at what aggro is whose.

Levels 4+5
I really don't know. Feel free to contribute.

**Special Tactic**
Using a "Lure". If you have a skilled player he should go to the opposite end 
of the spawn point and do circles, while focusing on nothing more than keeping
a large mob over there. More people spawn on the opposite end than on the 
spawn point, where most of your team is hiding. Even should this lure die, 
you'll have greatly diminished their numbers within a minute or so. 
Also if you clear out one side, your team can stand safely in the middle, 
throw grenades and fire mid range weapons from safety. Also since the Wizards
are practically immobilized you'll be continuously opening gaps for your team 
to kill them and kill them they will. Generally this level can be completed as 
long as you have one to two skillful players who keep their heads above water.

5. Rewards (C5)
******************************************************************************
Humongous Bone.
You get this occasionally from the boss. It has no use, other than to annoy
you. If you know what it does, send me an email, and I'll credit you.

Mysterious Skull
You get these from Wizards, they are also useless. With nothing to match them
to, they never activate. Might come into play in further updates.

Small Skulls
Sell. I'm not "kidding" you. I have 99 of them constantly and they do nothing.

Skeleton Dolls
Used in conjunction with Large Skulls. You'll have an overabundance of these,
so don't be afraid to sell them. You'll never need more than 10 at one time.

Large Skulls
These are the best drop you can get, besides boss item drops. These allow you
to take on Superion the Tainted. They are valuable.

**DEBATE TOPIC**
What do you do with Large Skulls? Do you keep them and run, or use them with 
the group who got it?

Here comes the hard part. You'll never beat the boss pre-25, unless you're an
amazing butterflyer, cheater, or all around amazing player. I haven't seen it
happen yet.

So here in lies the problem. There are 2 things you can do with Large Skulls.

1. Horde them till you can beat the boss.
2. Use the XP bonus to the benefit of the group and for practice.

What will your group say to do with them?
They'll say freaking use it. Why? Because they outnumber you, and if you walk
away, they don't get anything. They don't get the experience nor do they get
the skull. So they will ALWAYS pressure you to use it. If you can, avoid this
before hand by agreeing that whoever gets the skull will decide what to do with
it. There is nothing wrong with keeping it for yourself and waiting for a more
opportune group.

In all my time playing, I've wasted maybe 50 Large Skulls. In the end I
realized that that was 50 potential items lost. Sure I got better at fighting
the boss, but I also denied myself and other people the shot at the exclusive
items. The experience was undoubtably good, but you can join a "Shower Room
Berserker" and make that kind of experience very quickly. Sure the items are
temporary... but they sure are a nice show piece.

Don't be pressured into anything because or you will regret it. If anyone
starts kicking and screaming, they aren't mature enough to know why. Besides in
the time spent arguing over it, you could've scored another one. You should use
them a couple of times, but the boss isn't anything special and if you're 
reading this guide, by the end, you'll know soon enough what you're missing.
The more levels you do the better you'll get at the boss, the boss really isn't
anything you aren't used to, just more of the same.

8. Enemies (C8)
****************************************************************************

Skeletons
Your average baddie. Most of the time you'll ignore these guys until the end,
or when you're annoyed by them. They have a shield which will block your 
attacks with a resounding clang. This just makes them more annoying and 
generally you'll find your killing them since they are in your way of a mage.
Their attack does sting though so don't get careless - they swing pretty quick
and will do so immediately when you are in range. 

Skeleton Mage.
Will be regarded as "mages" from here on in. These guys are top priority. Once
you are comfortable killing the soldiers you'll be focusing on these guys.
They have three major attacks that you should make yourself familiar with.

 -Arrows
This is by far the most annoying attack in the game. This is why you attack the
mages before anyone else. You can barely see them coming and they move very
quickly. In hordes mages will become extremely problematic. Seek cover from
this attack whenever you can and be concious of it during every battle. They
fire in a straight line with only a little deviation, so try to circle them
and rotate left or right as you approach them. If you see a number of mages
collected, I guarantee you one of them is already sending a volley at you. If
you look at a group of mages and you see them, immediately start evading,
you'll thank yourself.

*important note about arrows*
They always use this attack first and it's usually heralded by them pointing,
but most of the time the arrows are in the air before they signal this attack.
So if you see them pointing they've already let the arrows fly and you need to
move immediately. However it has a cool down so once they release their arrows
you can usual suppress them (I mean exterminate them with extreme prejudice)
before they get another volley. You should dash straight at them and pump them
full of lead enough so to kill them.

 -Floating Things
These are annoying. You are going to bump into these regardless of what you do.
They also sometimes let these go as a revenge move for killing them. If you 
make them run into a wall or manage to get far enough away so they clip a 
corner, they dissapear. You can outrun them just barely but you have to keep 
moving. You can try moving in circles but eventually they are going to clip 
you. One easy way to avoid them if they are in your way is to simply jump over
them and do a tumble/dash. It becomes a matter of simple practice to avoid them
and judging when it is an acceptable loss to run into them rather than 
painstakingly avoid them (and getting yourself in trouble).

-Swipe
This is their cheap move. Usually you won't encounter this but when you do you
won't see it coming. If you've got a sword you can block it but generally when
you are that close they've spawned on top of you and are just going to smack
you one. Make them pay for it. Best thing to do is just keeps out of arms
reach of the mages, whenever possible.

Skeleton Soldiers
Will be hereby referred to as "Soldiers". These guys are normal skeletons on
steroids. They run very quickly and rabidly attack you with their sole move, an
overhead slice. Deceptively simple foes but when you encounter these guys in 
you should make it a habit of moving no matter what. It is so easy for one of 
them to spawn behind you when you weren't paying attention, or to switch 
targets from a nearby friend. So once you know they are on the map, keep 
dashing and tumbling and checking your back. You should never stop moving 
unless your in a safe zone (somewhere where your back is to something and no 
way they can sneak up on you). They take a number of rounds to take down 
regrettably so don't committ to killing one unless you are absolutely sure 
he's gonna die before he gets to you. If they get in range of attack, give up 
and let it go. It's really, really easy to want to take a hit in exchange for 
its death, but it'll sting more than its worth when you could just as easily 
run and finish it from safety. Get in the habit of keeping your distance and
hope to god nothing slows you down.

**Important Notes**
Never, EVER try to jump OVER them. Not only can you get stuck on their heads,
the overhead swing is effective directly above them. If you try to jump a mob
you can end up dead, fast. Instead practice zig zagging in front of them.
They have impressive vertical range for their attack, but the horizontal range
is pitiful. In fact, if you do a perfect circle they probably won't hit you 
which is a good tactic if you are using a dagger or are butterflying.

Skeleton Kings
This isn't their official name but it's easier to type. They are huge foes that
drop Large Skulls. More important than any tactics to kill it, the number one
thing you should be doing when you see them is making sure when they die to 
pick up a chest if they should leave one behind. This is the whole point of
doing quest mode dungeon and it is so easy to let the monotony of killing make
you forget that these guys are what you are here for.

Back to killing them. They attack much like soldiers but instead of an overhead
slice they attack with a baseball bat type swing with an abundantly large 
sword. This attack is fast, way faster than the soldiers swing so don't let him
get the chance to wing you. If you see him going to wing you, block because by
that point your chances of evading are slim. When in doubt cut right in front
of him and get behind him because the swing isn't fast enough to catch you if 
you dash at him. I say dash, not tumble. If you're in this guys range you 
should have your melee weapon out and be getting your distance from him. 
Generally you'll be herding these guys with soldiers but make sure to keep an
eye out for them.

*Important King Notes*
Once you know Kings are on the map, don't ever stop moving. You can only outrun
them if you're dashing / tumbling or momentum jumping. Normal running is barely
fast enough and if they are with soldiers they'll be pushing him forward so
running isn't going to help. When they are on the map keep dashing and doing
everything faster than you normally would. The exception is once they die to 
make SURE you pick up their chest should they drop one. It takes a little time
once the King is dead for the item to spawn, so I reccomend getting some 
distance its body and you, then returning once you know it's going to spawn 
soon. I can't stress enough this though - at any given moment one is, has, or
is going to be on your tail and if you aren't full on running, you may find 
yourself hit by a mysteriously appearing blade and then mobbed by soldiers.
Also if you're using a heavy weapon be sure to take into account your reduced
speed as they'll quickly close the gap between your back and you.

Wizards
General:
You won't encounter these foes until you reach level 3 quests and only in the
final battle of that level. However they will quickly become top priority to
eliminate, even higher than mobs of Mages. They have a few major attacks. They
have curiously high hit points, more than a soldier, so you're gonna need to
really pound them when you see them. Draw your best weapon and burn a clip into
them. You need to protect yourself and your team from these guys. The only time
you shouldn't drop everything to kill one is when they are surrounded by normal
mages, in which case you should finnagle a proper angle of attack in which to
score a hit (without being flagged down by an armada of arrows).

Attacks:
      -Slow (..you the hell down)
Whenever there is a wizard around you'll see your first real status effect.
Stars and circles will appear above your head and suddenly your movement speed
will be reduced about 50%. This is DEADLY to you because whatever level you are
in you are constantly evading. Should this effect befall you, IMMEDIATELY and
WITHOUT HESITATION draw your melee weapon and dash as HARD as you can. Forget
everything you were doing and put it off for the next five seconds until the
effect wears off then immediately regain your distance, then continue. Mages,
Soldiers, whatever, they'll find you an easy target if you aren't fighting this
effect.

      -Stun / Lightning
You'll see them summoning a lightning bolt by a crackling shield in front of
them. You won't see it hit you, but you'll see it stun you momentarily. It is
similar to a massive strike stun that the goblin mages give you, but not as
harsh; However this of course is bad enough, so be aware of it and when you are 
attacking Wizards, try to isolate them as best you can so you won't be mobbed
should this attack connect with you. Once again this attack doesn't really hit
a horizontal range so as long as you are outside it's normal attack range 
you'll probably evade it. If it's in a corner it's a bit trickier but you'll
manage.

|_________________________| 

Easy. Will add later, but basically bring something with enough ammo and
keep circling him. His attacks are fairly simple, he's basically an
overgrown shaman. The biggest things are being careful and keeping your
distance. Don't prioritize an attack over your health and you should make
it out of this one clean. Also keep in mind that the mages can stun you
and now, more than ever, it is important to avoid them.

Other than that, it shouldn't be nearly as difficult as...

 _________________________
|                         | 
|  Superion The Tainted   |
|_________________________| 

Welcome to Hell my friends.

General:
Take a good long look at the guy. You've made it this far, you're probably 
frustrated about how hard it was to just get here.

Forget all that, it was important practice which you'll need here.

His health bar is enormous, many a group has emptied, efficiently, every clip
they've had into this fiend and ne'er saw his life bar sufficiently drop. 
You'll witness that event firsthand a few times when your low enough of a
level. I wouldn't attempt this boss seriously until 25 since the weapons 
available to you, while competent in their damage estimates, are not enough
to diminish his health with the ammunition made available to you at spawn.
Also it is unlikely you'll be able to farm enough ammo to keep up a fight.
Unless you are more than the average joe with a melee weapon, you're gonna get
backed into a corner and be forced to fight tooth and nail for life and ammo.

He is faster than a King (or seems it) so you'll need to be dashing liberally.
Luckily the stage slows him down, but don't think the minions around will. He
plows through them like they aren't there. They'll slow you down for sure, but
they definitely won't trip him up like they do you. 

He has two main attacks, one you should be familiar with.

-King Strike
Same strike as a king except it stings more and seems a bit faster. It isn't
actually any faster, but you generally won't see his body movements as clearly
since his shoulder is 15 feet above you. You won't see it coming and will have
to resort to blocking again. The difference between the King strike and his, 
besides the damage, is that he's not afraid to do it again and again. If you 
are caught off guard and he clocks you, don't think its over, he will swing
again, whether or not you actually evade is up to you. If you hear yourself
get hit, don't think, just MOVE. Also I think it may be possible to block this,
as a last resort. However, I've never dared to attempt such madness.

-Sword Fireball
Here's what is going to keep you on your toes. LUCKILY you CAN see this one
coming. Moreso you should KNOW it's coming rather than see it coming. Whenever
you gain sufficient distance from the boss (or are unlucky enough to have a
teamie set him up for it) you'll see him ground himself (his feet shift) and 
he'll set up for a much larger swing. This swing is PRECEDED by the actual 
attack. Meaning the attack comes flying at you well before he actually swings.
It sweeps across the area extremely fast and is about as damaging as his strike
depending on how bad you've been hit. I don't believe you can block this, but
I need to investigate that more properly (as in general, I don't screw around
and test this guy).

Tactics:
Together with his super high health, his damage potential and the longevity of
this fight, more often than not you are going to fail in defeating him. There
is a few things you can do to try and terminate him, but none of them are 
"easy". First have someone side-dash around him constantly. He attacks in 
vertical lines, not horizontal. You can dash in a circle around him with 
relative safety. I say relative because if someone grabs his attention and he
swings at them, they'll surely avoid it, and you're probably gonna walk right
into it. Not only that, he'll be at the tail end of the attack and be ready
while you are still stunned. That's death. Keep on your toes, memorize the
land layout and know it intuitively, keep dashing and avoid teammates. Also be
aware should he become crowded with lesser enemies - you can't efficiently dash
over soldiers and they will be your undoing. Give him some space to follow you
a tad to remove those elements and have your team keep a fair distance to
ensure that you'll keep his aggro should you need to distance yourself avoiding
enemies or rounding a pillar.

Tactics (continued)
There is an alternative for the skilled. I've seen it done where someone who
was butterflying or using a knife can simply circle him while attacking.
However individuals who are that skilled generally don't need this FAQ. Should
one of your teammates seem quietly confident enough to butterfly, encourage him
or her to do so. However remind them that should he be struck, to abandon the
tactic and return to traditional tactics. An efficient butterflyer can circle
the boss, keep his aggro, and cause damage to him, while keeping your team 
freed from fear of death while they shoot from a safe range. However should
this tactic fail, the person die, or need to give up, your team should be 
prepared to shift back to running and gunning again.

 _____________________________
|                             | 
|    Aneramon The Wicked      |
|_____________________________|

This guy will keep you on your toes. Good Luck.

General:

I don't have as much experience with this one as I'd like, but here goes.
Forgive me for any inconsistencies - Mysterious skulls are not easy to come
by and when I do fight this guy, I'm not taking "notes".

The trick to this guy, is doing the same strategy you would for that level,
and with dealing with Wizards in general. Luckily this guy appears to have
less health than Superion and by the time you get to this guy you'll have
plenty of ability at dishing it out. It also may simply be that since this
guy is practically stationary, you'll be hitting him much more.

Unfortunately that's the only thing that really is easier about this boss.

He spawns an enormous amount of Wizards to accompany him, along with 
other assorted minions. The wizards however will quickly begin to cause a
serious problem - your entire team will be getting slowed without mercy.
Also, since Wizards take more damage to kill, they are gonna drain your
ammo, and although Aneramon isn't as hardy as superion, you're still gonna 
need to ammo farm at one point to keep the battle up.

Attacks

-Lightning Blast
He (she?) spits out a number of lightning bolts in a wave. They go in a
straight line perpendicular to you. They come at you in this pattern:
     
     +Boss

 | | | | |
 | | | | |   <---Bolts

     *You

They aren't particularly damaging... but they can be hard to avoid.
I'm sure you avid gamers are scoffing at the idea of this attack since
it's so easy and common... however, the attack is a little broken.
More than once you're going to walk right through one of the bolts and
wonder, what happened?

The trick is, the bolts hit faster than they appear, meaning they hit
you physically before the image ever gets to you - much like superions
fireballs - if you see these coming you have to clear the bolts pattern
before the animation actually gets to you - however even then, it's
pretty forgiving. Sometimes you'll have enough time to completely
circumvent this attack by going all the way around it - which you
may find commonplace if you're the one holding him/her.

-swipe
Much like the mage swipe, this boss can swipe at you. It's annoying and
a reminder to not get too close... but it's not as fast as Superions
home run slice, so don't be afraid of this one unless your bumbling
around Aneramon.

-Slow/Stun?
I'm not sure if it's the boss stunning / slowing you, or the abundance
of Wizards. Generally I've been the one holding whenever I face this one,
so I'm not really sure. More on this later.

Tactics:

Stick with the same strategies for Superion and for this level. Luckily,
this level benefits your strategy immensely when manipulated, and will 
cripple you if you don't manipulate it. When the round starts, get some
fast to go up and start holding his attention. What you want is for him to
stay near the end of the level, while your team manages the middle part of
the bridge. They, from afar, can easily attack the boss and use up their
primary ammo. Those of who are afar, be ammo efficent - don't miss. The
bosses lightning attack, more often than not, will fly harmlessly into
a wall or other direction. Very rarely will it happen to put your team in
danger. This strategy works very well, my first attempt on this boss and
we were almost successful. However unless your very, very fast, you're 
gonna start dwindling health. The person holding is eventually gonna have
to swap somebody out, and that's going to be tricky. Best thing to do is
agree on this - should someone run out of ammo, they should begin holding.
If the holder sees another person in his zone, he should make sure he's
lost the aggro, then leave. Two people shouldn't try to hold for too long
since it's very dangerous. Should the holder get into trouble, they should
flee and someone should take over IMMEDIATELY.

This is a basic tactic, but it works fairly well. More to come on this one
as I experiment with the boss.

****************************************************************************
**Guidelines For All Bosses**
****************************************************************************

1. Have a competent team. You can't have any weak links in the chain. You'll 
need every single round pumped into him to have a chance and if someone dies
before they do so, then they've already put a dent at your chance for success.
Accidents happen, but usually one accident isn't fatal. If someone dies in the
first 30 seconds, you picked somebody wrong for the team or are just plain
unlucky. Everyone on the team should be responsible for their own life - 
if you can keep your entire team alive long enough for them to expend their
ammo AND hit with it, you're well on your way to victory even should 2 of
your teammates die directly after. On an another note - I'm talking to you,
not to your team. If you die with any more ammo than what you were saving
to farm, you need to focus on staying alive next time.

2. Teamwork
Everyone says there is no "I" in team. I think everyone is full of themselves.
You need to think for yourself in this one. Given the way the game is played,
everyones fighting for their own life. If you're playing good, you won't even
see your teammates (unless one is butterflying around him). Instead, USE your
teammates. Whoever is closest to Superion, and thusly holding his aggro, 
should "hold" him rather than doing damage. If someone else is "holding" him, 
you should be concerned with hurting him from afar.This should all go unsaid.
Bosses switch aggro in the blink of an eye, a drop of the hat, and always 
when you least expect it. Keep in mind he'll attack whoever is closest.
However if you maintain these guidelines for yourself, everyone will work 
together without even having to say anything. In fact, the only thing that
should be said, ever, during this entire match, is if someone dies they 
should update you on your teammates health status. That's  the only 
"talking" I've ever found remotely useful. Otherwise, indirectly or not, 
you're gonna slow the living person down because they can't help but read. 
If you have to chat, open a chat channel or whisper.

3. Farming Powerups and Killing Mages.
You won't beat a boss, even if you pump every round that every teammate has
into him, without scoring a powerup. You HAVE to get some yellow powerups 
flowing. You ALSO need to kill the mages. These fights are long. Really long. 
The mages are your enemy because they will slowly wear you down as the round 
goes on with arrows. This, luckily, serves a dual purpose, since generally it's 
mages who drop the powerups. Also if the area becomes vacant of mages, you 
need to kill some normal enemies so that new enemies will spawn, meaning 
mages. Generally, I'd save a little ammo from your killing weapons, to farm
some for your ammo-efficient weapon. I'd suggest 1 clip from your AR should be
saved for farming and don't let your team tell you otherwise. Save that clip,
kill 5 mages with it, and with any luck you'll be back in business.

4. Plan Appropriately and Remain Ammo Efficient.
*Short Version*
Get the latest Machine Gun(s). Pray for Ammo powerups.

*Long Version*
Why you say? Because 1 yellow powerup gives you effectively half your ammo
back. Which you'll be in dire need of if you are on the road to victory. Also
as a guideline I'd keep a half a clip of that machine gun so you can use it
to farm ammo + health. I know it's hard, your dead teammates will be screaming 
at you to get back into the fight. They'll kick and claw and yelp. But that is
why they're dead and you're not. Someone should be maintaining aggro and if you 
are alone, good luck trying to farm. Get far away from the boss, find a mage,
kill it, cross your fingers for ammo (or possibly badly needed health).

Keep this in mind as well - ammo is more important than health. You can win
with more ammo, you can only stay alive longer to get ammo with more health.
Also the time it takes to grab the health, to focus on how to get to it and
usually turning your back on the boss, all usually means a mage is gonna shave
that 10 life off you as soon as you get it. It's an annoying truth.

In Regards To Other Equipment.
Most of the information in the "Equipment" section still applies, but some
things need to be emphasized or added on.

Keep in mind you are fighting an incredibly hardy boss and you'll need every
drop of ammunition.

You'll need the following, without question.

| Grenades (many as you can, makes farming easier and more fruitful) |
| Machine Gun. The yellow powerups make this a no brainer.           |

Aside from that, think ammo efficiency for your secondary weapon. Weapons with
high starting ammo counts especially are great, because once this runs dry you
should use any yellow powerups you get for your big gun (which gives you more
damage per ammo powerup).

I reccomend AR's, and I've heard Revolvers are fine choices. The level 28
revolver might just be as good as the Maxwell, or so I've heard. I stick with
my Maxwell, but don't let me stop you. Experiment.

5. Don't forget to puck up the (beep)'ing ITEM.
... you know you've seen somebody do it. Also don't sweat the drop. Half the
time you will get something you can't use, 3/4 times you won't get it, and the
other times, well, you're gonna lose anyway. Focus on XP + valuable killing
experience.

6. Don't kick people just before the boss dies.
It won't change anything.

10. Is it worth it? (C10)
****************************************************************************
The boss doesn't always drop an item you know. You also have a 1/4 chance of
getting that item. You also have a much stronger chance than you'd like, to
pickup an item that's intended for the opposite sex of your character. Yeah,
it'll happen a few times. There isn't anything you can do about that. Also, you
could get yet another boss item and have to start this whole cycle over again.
Yeah it's hard.

If you don't have a clan that can annihilate this boss with, I'd start looking
for one, or stop question entirely.
