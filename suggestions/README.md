<b>[SUGGESTIONS] (My idea to get gunz alive again)</b><br>
- GunZ on browser (for example: https://github.com/LostMyCode/three-gunz - would be really cool!) <br>
- Project ZNUG (changing the netcode fixing p2p networking) <br>
- Old blender(.elu/plugins import/export) - 3DSMax too newer version (for example: 2022) <br>
- Better graphics(changing realspace2 engine), new gamemodes(for example: new tournament, clanwar system) <br>
- Make videos for the new people who want to learn gunz so that there will be more developers in gunz community and new ideas <br>
- Assist System (hit an opponent and you get 1 assist + but you also get half of 'exp' for it, so "KS" thingy won't be there anymore xp) <br>
- Linux Gunz Server / Client
