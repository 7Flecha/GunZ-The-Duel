So, I got tired of people refusing packets from other players (which allowed them to grab a CTF Flag without being attacked), and fixed it. Since it's a pretty nasty exploit, I thought i'd share the fix (Note: Not telling where you put this, people that have any business opening th esource should know where it goes and what to replace). <br>

Fix:<br>

    if( !CheckBitSet(pItem->GetSpawnTypeFlags(), WORLD_ITEM_STAND_ALINE) )
    {
    //If PlayerCount < 4 let them grab the flag even if they cheat, it doesn't matter.
    if ((int)ZGetCharacterManager()->size() >= 4 && ZGetGame()->GetMatch()->GetMatchType() == MMATCH_GAMETYPE_CTF)
    {
    int nFoulCount = 0;
    int nPlayerCount = 0;
    for (auto itor = ZGetGameClient()->GetPeers()->begin(); itor != ZGetGameClient()->GetPeers()->end(); ++itor)
    {
    ZCharacter* pCharacter = ZGetCharacterManager()->Find((*itor).first);
    //Valid connection to teamm8's is unnecessary for this fix
    if (pCharacter->GetTeamID() == ZGetGame()->m_pMyCharacter->GetTeamID())
    continue;
    //ignore a connection to yourself
    if (pCharacter->GetUID() == ZGetGame()->m_pMyCharacter->GetUID())
    continue;
    //Increment based on enemies team size
    nPlayerCount+=1;
    //if you fail to connect to a player of the opposite team,increment foulcount
    if (pCharacter->m_dwStatusBitPackingValue.Ref().m_bLostConEffect)
    {
    ++nFoulCount;
    }
    }
    //this is assuming both teams have equal players, critique it how you like
    if (nFoulCount >= nPlayerCount)
    {
    //add a check to prevent spam if you want, i think it's rather useful to spam the message
    ZChatOutput("Error: Unable to obtain flag, please check your connection and rejoin.");
    return;
    }
    //all is well, allow the player to capture the flag
    ZPostRequestObtainWorldItem(ZGetGameClient()->GetPlayerUID(), pItem->GetID());
    }
    else
    ZPostRequestObtainWorldItem(ZGetGameClient()->GetPlayerUID(), pItem->GetID());
    }
    else
    {
    ZPostLocalEventOptainSpecialWorldItem(int(pItem->GetItemID()));
    }
