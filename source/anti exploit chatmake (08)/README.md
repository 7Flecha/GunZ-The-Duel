Hello everyone, <br>

Today I came to post an ant exploit, which is not complete, it is still in progress, so it may not work completely. <br>

Here is the tutorial: <br>

1 - Decompile your system.mrs <br>
2 - Open your strings.xml file <br>
3 - Ctrl + F search for /chatmake, in strings, you change the name of the command "/chatmake <br>
4 - Save, and open abuse.txt <br>
5 - And there, write this <br>
"1, chatmake <br>
1, % " <br>

That's it! <br>
